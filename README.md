This project analyzes smoking behaviour among Nigeria youths, focusing on factors influencing cigarette smoking, reasons for smoking, and addiction levels.

## Dataset

- Age
- Gender
- Location
- Education Level
- Employment Status
- Smoking Status
- Age at Initiation
- Frequency of Smoking
- Type of Tobacco Product
- Perceived Health Status
- Awareness of Health Risks
- Reasons for Smoking
- Intent to Quit
- Previous Quit Attempts
- Access to Cessation Support
- Influence of Advertising
- Cost of Smoking
- Economic Status

## Analysis Performed

### Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Removal of duplicates
- Handling missing values
- Ensuring data Consistency

### Analysis
- Univariate, Bivariate, and Multivariate analysis to explore the distribution, relationships and combined effects of the factors on smoking behaviour.

## Findings

Key Insights Include:
- Reasons for smoking such as stress relief and addiction are prevalent amont Nigerian Youths, highlighting the importance of addressing social and pyschological factors in smoking cessation efforts.
- Addiction Levels vary among different smoking statuses, with current smokers showing higher frequencies of smoking compared to former and never smokers.
- The analysis reveals that Age and Gender have significant relationship, showing that Early initiation of smoking especially among females, is correlated with higher smoking frequencies, and older males (ages 22-24) show more consistent smoking habits, with a notable proportion smoking around 4-5 times per day. Both education level and employment status plays roles in influencing smoking behaviour, with a high rate of cigratte smokers compare to other Tobacco products. This suggests targeted interventions might be necessary for younger age groups to prevent early initiation.
- Different locations exhibit different primary reasons for smoking. Kano, with its high addiction rates, may need different strategies compared to Kaduna, where stress relief is a significant factor.
- Students exhibit high counts across various reasons, indicating that educational settings might be critical for smoking smoking prevention programs. Unemployment seems to correlate strongly with addiction, suggesting economic factors play a role in smoking behaviours.
- There's a clear correlation between perceived poorer health and higher smoking frequencies. Public health campaigns could emphasize the health risks associated with frequent smoking to improve health perceptions and reduce smoking rates.

## Conclusion

The Project provides insights into smoking behaviors among Nigeria youths, which can inform targeted prevention and cessaton programs.
